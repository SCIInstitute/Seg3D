# Viewing Options

There are several options to change the layout and data viewing in Seg3D. As mentioned before, several windows can be moved and undocked to customize the layout. The viewing panels can also be altered so that there are virtually any number (up to six) and any size. Viewing panel sizes can be adjusted by clicking and dragging on the borders. This may change the sizes of several panels at once, but there are several different configurations available in the **View** menu at the top of the screen. The various options are explained below.

## Full Screen

This is a unique and useful viewing option will cause Seg3D to use all of the real estate of whatever screen you are using. Full screen mode will cover everything else that may be open on your desktop, including the common menus on the top and bottom of the screen. The top tool bar will reappear if the mouse is held at the top of the screen momentarily, allowing the user to choose any tools or filters desired. Full screen mode is enable and disabled by clicking on the option in the menu, or by using the shortcut CTRL/CMD+F.

## One Viewer

This and the following viewing options should be self evident. This option will show only one viewer. This is useful if you only care about one view at a time because it maximizes screen real estate. This one viewer can still be switch between the three slice orientations and the volume viewer.

## One and One

This will display two viewers side by side.

## One and Two

This will create three viewers, one bigger one on the left and two smaller ones stacked on the right.

## One and Three

This is the default configuration, though it can be changed in the preferences. This generates four viewers, one large one on the left and three smaller ones stacked on the right. One and Three is a useful configuration because most people do more work in a single view, giving the user one large space to work, but use the other views as references only, so they do not take as much space.

## Two and Two

This will generate four viewers of equal size, two on the left and right, which is useful when segmenting in multiple planes simultaneously.

## Two and Three

This generates five viewers, two on the left and three on the right, for when four just doesnâ€™t cut it.

## Three and Three

This generates six viewers, the maximum number, three on the left and right. This is generally used when multiple planes in the same direction are needed. These planes can be locked together as the user scrolls through them.
