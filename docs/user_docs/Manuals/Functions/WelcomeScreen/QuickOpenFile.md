# Quick Open File

This option is the same as the **File** ⇒ **[Import Layer From Single File...](File.md#import-layer-from-single-file)** menu item. You may choose a file to load into Seg3D for viewing. All of the filters and tools will be available, but the project can not be saved automatically until a project name is created by using the **File** ⇒ **[Save Project As](File.md#save-project-as)** menu item.
This option does not allow the opening of image stacks.
