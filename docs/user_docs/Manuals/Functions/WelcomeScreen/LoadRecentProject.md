# Load Recent Project

This option allows the users to quickly open a project recently opened in Seg3D. The list of recent projects is shown in the text box above the **Load Recent Project** button. This option will be unavailable unless one of the recent projects in the list is selected. Updating or reinstalling Seg3D may erase the saved list of recent projects even though the projects still exist.
