Seg3D Windows
========================================

In addition to the viewer windows discussed in the above chapter, there are several other windows involved in streamlining the user interface of the Seg3D software. Each of these windows can be accessed through the ’Window’ drop-down menu. By default these windows appear in certain positions defined below, but each can be undocked from the Seg3D interface and either left as stand alone windows or repositioned elsewhere on the Seg3D application (see :doc:`Controlling Windows <../Seg3DViewer/ControllingWindows>`).
