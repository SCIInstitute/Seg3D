# Event Log Tab

The event log shows actions that have been taken on the session since the latest load of the session. If Seg3D is closed, and then reopened, the event log will only record the history for the newly opened session. This differs from the action tab in this way, which collects actions for the entire history of the session. The event log also differs from the action log in that it records all events involved with running Seg3D, not just the actions. This is also a non-editable tab.
